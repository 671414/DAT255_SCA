Deep Learning-Based Key Byte Recovery from Tiny-AES Encrypted Power Traces





This project is a part of our DAT255 Deep learning engineering course at the Western Norway University Of Applied science.
Our task is to build upon already existing deep learning models, and train it on our own dataset.

Our project recovering a key-byte from a tiny-AES encrypted power trace.

We will use our own data, that we collect chipwhisperer. We have already gathered two datasets with 1 000 000 traces.
Our contingency plan is to use datasets from this library https://github.com/google/scaaml/blob/main/scaaml_intro/README.md

We are planning to use Resnet v2
